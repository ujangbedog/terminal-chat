# DPQ Chat

A secure peer-to-peer chat application built with Rust that implements post-quantum cryptography to protect against both classical and quantum computer attacks. The system uses CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures and CRYSTALS-Kyber for key exchange, providing quantum-resistant security for all communications.

Features a terminal-based interface with real-time messaging, decentralized architecture (no central servers), and hybrid cryptographic protocols that combine classical and post-quantum algorithms for maximum security.

## üîÑ Complete Cryptographic Flow

### 1. Identity Generation Process
When a user first runs the application, the system performs the following steps:

1. **Key Pair Generation**:
   - Generates a CRYSTALS-Dilithium key pair (public/private keys)
   - Creates a unique fingerprint from the public key for identity verification
   - Generates cryptographic random values for enhanced security

2. **Password-Based Encryption**:
   - Prompts user for a secure password
   - Uses Argon2id (password hashing function) to derive encryption key from password
   - Encrypts the private key using AES-256-GCM with the derived key
   - Stores encrypted private key securely in `~/.dpq-chat/identities/`

3. **Identity Storage**:
   - Saves identity metadata (username, creation date, expiration, fingerprint)
   - Stores encrypted private key separately from metadata
   - Creates backup-friendly format for identity portability

### 2. Authentication & Key Loading Process
When starting a chat session:

1. **Identity Discovery**:
   - Scans `~/.dpq-chat/identities/` for available identities
   - Presents list of identities to user for selection
   - Validates identity integrity and expiration status

2. **Password Verification**:
   - Prompts for password to decrypt selected identity
   - Derives decryption key using stored Argon2id parameters
   - Attempts to decrypt private key with derived key
   - Validates decrypted key format and integrity

3. **Session Preparation**:
   - Loads decrypted private key into secure memory
   - Prepares public key for peer verification
   - Initializes cryptographic contexts for the session

### 3. P2P Connection & Handshake Process
When establishing peer connections:

1. **Network Discovery**:
   - Uses multicast UDP for local peer discovery
   - Announces presence with encrypted identity information
   - Listens for peer announcements on the network

2. **Hybrid Post-Quantum Handshake**:
   - **Step 1**: Kyber Key Exchange
     - Peer A initiates Kyber key encapsulation
     - Generates Kyber public key and sends to Peer B
     - Peer B responds with Kyber ciphertext
     - Both peers derive shared secret from Kyber exchange
   
   - **Step 2**: Dilithium Authentication
     - Each peer signs handshake data with their Dilithium private key
     - Handshake data includes: peer info + Kyber exchange + timestamp
     - Signatures are verified using peer's Dilithium public key
     - Ensures authentic identity and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
   
   - **Step 3**: Session Key Derivation
     - Shared secret from Kyber ‚Üí SHA-256 ‚Üí 32-byte AES session key
     - Each peer-to-peer connection has unique session key
     - Session keys expire after 1 hour for forward secrecy

### 4. Message Flow & Security
During active chat sessions:

1. **Message Encryption Process**:
   ```
   Plain Message ‚Üí JSON Serialize ‚Üí AES-256-GCM(session_key) ‚Üí Encrypted Message
   ```
   - Each message encrypted with peer-specific session key (derived from handshake)
   - Unique nonce generated for each message (prevents replay attacks)
   - Message sequence numbers ensure ordering and detect duplicates
   - Authenticated encryption provides both confidentiality and integrity

2. **Message Authentication**:
   - Messages are authenticated through AES-GCM (not individually signed)
   - Session key authenticity guaranteed by Dilithium-signed handshake
   - Any tampering with encrypted messages will fail decryption
   - Peer identity verified once during handshake, not per message

3. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**:
   - Session keys derived fresh from each Kyber handshake
   - Keys automatically expire after 1 hour
   - Old session keys securely erased from memory
   - Compromise of current keys doesn't affect past communications

```

## üöÄ Getting Started & Usage Guide

### First Time Setup

#### Step 1: Generate Your Cryptographic Identity
Before you can use DPQ Chat, you need to create a cryptographic identity. This identity consists of a CRYSTALS-Dilithium key pair for authentication and handshake signing.

```bash
cargo run -- generate-key
```

**What happens during identity generation:**
1. System prompts for username (becomes your chat display name)
2. You create a secure password (encrypts your private key)
3. System generates CRYSTALS-Dilithium key pair (public + private keys)
4. Private key encrypted with password using AES-256-GCM + Argon2id
5. Identity saved to `~/.dpq-chat/identities/[username].json`
6. Unique fingerprint generated from public key (your identity hash)

**Security Features:**
- Password never stored - only used to derive encryption key via Argon2id
- Private key never leaves device in unencrypted form
- Fingerprint serves as your unique peer identifier
- Identity files are portable and can be backed up securely

#### Step 2: Verify Your Identity
After generation, you can list your identities to verify creation:

```bash
cargo run -- list
```

This will show:
- Your username and status (ACTIVE/EXPIRED)
- Your unique fingerprint (first 8 characters shown for brevity)
- Creation date and expiration date (if set)
- The cryptographic algorithm used (CRYSTALS-Dilithium)

### Starting a Chat Session

#### Method 1: Interactive Menu (Recommended for Beginners)

Start the application without any arguments to access the interactive menu:

```bash
cargo run
```

**Authentication Process:**
1. System scans for available identities in `~/.dpq-chat/identities/`
2. If multiple identities exist, you select one from the list
3. Enter password for your selected identity
4. System decrypts Dilithium private key using Argon2id + AES-256-GCM
5. HandshakeManager initialized with your Dilithium keypair
6. You're authenticated and ready for secure P2P connections

**Menu Navigation:**
- Use arrow keys (‚Üë/‚Üì) to navigate menu options
- Press Enter to select an option
- Press Esc or Ctrl+C to exit

**Menu Options:**
1. **üîó Create P2P Chat**: Start a new chat room that others can join
2. **üè† Join Chat Room**: Connect to an existing chat room
3. **‚öôÔ∏è Settings**: View configuration and manage identities
4. **üö™ Exit**: Close the application

#### Method 2: Direct CLI Mode (Advanced Users)

For advanced users who prefer command-line interfaces:

- `-p, --port`: Specific port to use (optional, auto-selects from 40000-40010)
- `-b, --bootstrap`: Address of peer to connect to (IP:PORT format)

### Detailed Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Two Friends on Same Network

**Alice starts a new chat room:**
```bash
# Alice runs the application
cargo run

# Authentication process:
# 1. System finds Alice's identity
# 2. Alice enters her password
# 3. Private key is decrypted and loaded

# Menu selection:
# 1. Alice selects "üîó Create P2P Chat"
# 2. System prompts for network interface:
#    - "üè† Localhost (127.0.0.1)" - only local machine
#    - "üåê Local Network (192.168.x.x)" - same WiFi/LAN
#    - "üåç All Interfaces (0.0.0.0)" - internet accessible
# 3. Alice selects "üåê Local Network"
# 4. System automatically finds available port (e.g., 40000)
# 5. Chat room starts, showing:
#    - Alice's username and fingerprint
#    - Listening address (e.g., 192.168.1.100:40000)
#    - "‚è≥ Waiting for peers..." status
```

**Bob joins Alice's chat:**
```bash
# Bob runs the application
cargo run

# Authentication process (same as Alice)
# Bob enters his password to decrypt his identity

# Menu selection:
# 1. Bob selects "üîó Create P2P Chat"
# 2. Bob selects "üîó Connect to existing peer"
# 3. System prompts for peer address
# 4. Bob enters: 192.168.1.100:40000
# 5. System establishes secure connection:
#    - Kyber key exchange generates shared secret
#    - Both peers sign handshake data with Dilithium private keys
#    - Signatures verified using each other's public keys
#    - Session key derived from Kyber shared secret
#    - Encrypted communication channel established
# 6. Both users see connection confirmation with peer fingerprints
```

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Users Joining

**Charlie joins the existing chat:**
```bash
cargo run

# Charlie follows the same process as Bob
# Enters Alice's address: 192.168.1.100:40000
# System automatically discovers Bob through Alice
# All three users are now connected in a mesh network
```

**Network Topology:**
- Each user maintains direct connections to all other users
- Messages are sent directly between peers (no routing through Alice)
- If Alice leaves, Bob and Charlie remain connected
- New users can join through any existing peer

#### Scenario 3: Internet Chat (Advanced)

**Alice creates internet-accessible chat:**
```bash
cargo run

# Alice selects "üåç All Interfaces (0.0.0.0)"
# This binds to all network interfaces
# Alice shares her public IP and port with Bob
# Example: 203.0.113.10:40000
```

**Bob connects from different network:**
```bash
cargo run

# Bob enters Alice's public address: 203.0.113.10:40000
# Connection works across internet (requires port forwarding)
```
